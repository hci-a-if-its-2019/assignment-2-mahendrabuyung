# Sketching and Prototyping
Using the information in the results of Assignment 1 for what is good and bad about the UI for designed tasks, we are going to make **Sketches** and **Prototypes**. These sketches and prototypes will lead to better design in Assignment 3. The prototypes will be then tested through a usability evaluation followed by design revision in Assignment 4.

## Part A: Sketches
Sketch at least **3 (three)** different UIs for the functions you are targeting. These three interfaces should be _dramatically different_ in terms of design directions. For example, they can be with different organizations of what functions on each screen or using a different layout of the icons, widgets, and menus on the screens. If you want, you can also incorporate non-on-screen UIs: physical buttons, gestures through motion sensors, etc.

You need **not** sketch the whole interface. It is not necessary for the sketches to have every function or every function in detail, but there should be enough to show off your general idea. **Be creative!** Draw your idea and label a few of the widgets so we can tell your intent. The goal is to have at least 3 good UIs in *interesting* ways. Sketches should be done on paper with pens and/or pencils (do not use a computer).

### 2. Version Differences
The differences from the three versions of the UI solution that I describe are:
1. The first version has an appearance that is almost the same as the original version, but in version 1 it has an additional search bar, besides the category bar above the channel selection directly it is easier to search for radio channels based on the category.
2. The second version has a search bar under the myTunerRadio logo and has a setting button on the top right to make access settings easier. And the menu bar at the bottom is simplified into 3 menus that include several menus in the original version.
3. The third version has the search bar and settings above like the second version, but the difference lies in the placement of the categorized menu bar on the left of the screen and the bar category for the radio channel on the top right using the slide bar feature (left and right) , so that the menu bar at the bottom of the screen is removed.

### 3. Selected Sketch
From the three version that I describe, I prefer to choose the first version.

### 4. Design Rationale
Based on the rationale design and contextual inquiry, the first version is a suitable display because it has a complete menu menu and is visible in the initial display of the application. With the search bar and setting buttons make it easier for users to operate. Besides that with a menu bar with fewer and simpler choices, it will make it easier for users to reach the desired choices.

## Part B: Assumptions
### 1. Hardware
1. Operating System : iOS for iPhone
2. Screen Resolution  : 1334x750 (326 ppi, minus one row of pixels) or higher.
3. Screen Color : 
  - Background (Major Color) : White
  - Accent (Minor Color)  : Red
  - Word  : Black
  - Others : RGB
4. Input  : Touch Screen
5. Output : Speaker or Headset

### 2. Users
1. The experience level is based on how fast the user can operate the main menu of the application.
2. All users that ever operating the radio/music/video streamer application.
3. The users age about 15-50 years old.

## Part C: Prototypes
We will work on this part together during the class on **March 22nd, 2019**, 10:00 AM - 12.30 PM. Therefore, prior to the class please complete all the above parts (A & B) beforehand accordingly.
